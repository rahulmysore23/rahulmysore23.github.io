[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eA few months ago, I found myself constantly juggling multiple custom services at work. These services were binaries written in Go, designed for data observability purposes. While they were efficient at their job, managing them was a bit of a hassle. I often had to check their status, restart them, or stop them entirely using the \u003ccode\u003esystemctl\u003c/code\u003e command. Typing \u003ccode\u003esystemctl status \u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e over and over again started to feel tedious. Sure, I could have created aliases, but I wanted something more interactive—a \u003cstrong\u003eTUI (Terminal User Interface)\u003c/strong\u003e that would make the process smoother and more enjoyable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when I decided to start a side project: \u003cstrong\u003esysdmon\u003c/strong\u003e, a TUI-based systemd service manager written in Go.

Zero. Zilch. Nada. We showed up with our laptops, a vague sense of excitement, and a whole lot of caffeine.
