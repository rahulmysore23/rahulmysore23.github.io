      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, folks, gather &amp;lsquo;round. Let me tell you the story of my first interview with a blockchain company (which shall remain nameless, because, well, NDAs are a thing). It was Round 1, and the focus was on OS/System Programming. The interview was scheduled for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and I was told to have a Linux environment ready. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. This is where the adventure begins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
