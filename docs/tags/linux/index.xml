      <title>Startup Interview and Defunct Process</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, folks, gather &amp;lsquo;round. Let me tell you the story of my interview with a blockchain company (which shall remain nameless, because, well, NDAs are a thing). It was Round 1, and the focus was on OS/System Programming. The interview was scheduled for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and I was told to have a Linux environment ready. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. This is where the adventure begins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-setup-windows-wsl2-and-a-dash-of-desperation&#34;&gt;The Setup: Windows, WSL2, and a Dash of Desperation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the thing: I was using Windows at the time. &lt;em&gt;Gasp!&lt;/em&gt; I know, I know. But hear me out—I was in the process of switching to &lt;strong&gt;Hyprland&lt;/strong&gt; (a fancy tiling window manager for Linux), and I didn’t want to risk breaking my system right before an interview. So, I did what any sane person would do: I fired up &lt;strong&gt;WSL2&lt;/strong&gt; (Windows Subsystem for Linux). It’s like having a Linux terminal inside Windows, which is great until you realize you’re essentially living in two operating systems at once. Schrödinger’s developer, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a TUI for Managing Systemd Services: A Fun Side Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I found myself constantly juggling multiple custom services at work. These services were binaries written in Go, designed for data observability purposes. While they were efficient at their job, managing them was a bit of a hassle. I often had to check their status, restart them, or stop them entirely using the &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; command. Typing &lt;code&gt;systemctl status &amp;lt;service&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; over and over again started to feel tedious. Sure, I could have created aliases, but I wanted something more interactive—a &lt;strong&gt;TUI (Terminal User Interface)&lt;/strong&gt; that would make the process smoother and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Linux Journey: From Ubuntu to Hyprland, Vim to Tiling Window Managers, and Everything In Between</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever fallen down the rabbit hole of Linux, you know how addictive it can be. For me, it all started back in 2016. I was a curious kid with a laptop that barely ran Windows, and I stumbled upon Ubuntu. Little did I know, that first installation would spark a lifelong passion for tinkering, customizing, and optimizing my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beginning-ubuntu-and-the-linux-curiosity&#34;&gt;The Beginning: Ubuntu and the Linux Curiosity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started with Ubuntu—like most people do. It was simple, user-friendly, and felt like a breath of fresh air compared to Windows. But soon, I wanted more. I tried Pop!_OS for its sleek design and gaming optimizations, Linux Mint for its familiarity, Fedora for its cutting-edge features, and even Garuda Linux because, let’s be honest, it looked &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
