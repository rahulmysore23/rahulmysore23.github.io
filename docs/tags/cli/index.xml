      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, folks, gather &amp;lsquo;round. Let me tell you the story of my interview with a blockchain company (which shall remain nameless, because, well, NDAs are a thing). It was Round 1, and the focus was on OS/System Programming. The interview was scheduled for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and I was told to have a Linux environment ready. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. This is where the adventure begins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-setup-windows-wsl2-and-a-dash-of-desperation&#34;&gt;The Setup: Windows, WSL2, and a Dash of Desperation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the thing: I was using Windows at the time. &lt;em&gt;Gasp!&lt;/em&gt; I know, I know. But hear me out—I was in the process of switching to &lt;strong&gt;Hyprland&lt;/strong&gt; (a fancy tiling window manager for Linux), and I didn’t want to risk breaking my system right before an interview. So, I did what any sane person would do: I fired up &lt;strong&gt;WSL2&lt;/strong&gt; (Windows Subsystem for Linux). It’s like having a Linux terminal inside Windows, which is great until you realize you’re essentially living in two operating systems at once. Schrödinger’s developer, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
