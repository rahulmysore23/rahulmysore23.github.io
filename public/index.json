It was cool as I wanted to have one of my own. I got motivated and started one of mine. Nvm what it was called (Though I spent days thinking about a name) because it was just another typical how to solve a leetcode problem. Yeah, I get it! There are millions of blogs on how to do those. But, It got me started on blogging. I posted 2-3 times. It was the same old style of \u0026ldquo;DSA\u0026rdquo; blogs and never really excited me anymore. I had very little real-world experience and I soon deleted the blog after getting my first job as a software engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"after-a-while\"\u003eAfter a while\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been 5 years since I started working as a software engineer. I\u0026rsquo;ve worn different hats in the past 5 years doing Front-End, Back-end, Platform Engineering, Leading teams, Mentoring, and most importantly solving software problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I deleted the blog, I always wanted to have my presence on the internet sharing my experiences in the tech industry, knowledge on not-so-good documented tools/software, System setup for productivity, and technical problems with solutions I\u0026rsquo;ve come across in my experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"new-beginnings\"\u003eNew beginnings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve quit my job as a software engineer after 5 years working in 4 companies (3 of them being startups) to pursue my Masters degree in Computer Science. I want to utilize this time for my learning and making blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blog aims to share my experiences as a software engineer and blogs on how to set up or do things which are not easy to understand. This is also a commitment that I\u0026rsquo;m making to be consistent and disciplined in blogging.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/blogs/first_post/","title":"My Presence on the Internet"}]
