Here’s what I’m up to right now.

### Life Update

I moved to a new city about four months ago. It’s been a fun adjustment — new routines, new coffee spots, and slowly settling into the rhythm of the place.

### Work

I’m currently working as a **Lead Software & Devops Engineer** at a startup. The pace is fast, the challenges are real, and I’m learning a lot by building and shipping quickly with a small team.

### Currently Learning

Right now, I’m focused less on formal certifications or structured courses, and more on **practical, hands-on learning** through work and collaboration. I’ve been diving into **System Design Fight Club** and other community-driven discussions to sharpen my architecture thinking in real-world contexts.

### Projects

I’m still tinkering with personal projects at the intersection of AI and music. They’re evolving slowly, but I love the process of blending creativity with technology.

### Anime, Music & Books

- **Currently Watching**: [My Anime List profile](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pre5ence) — always open to recommendations!
- **Music**: Trying to find time to play guitar, It's been over a year since I last made a cover.
- **Reading**: Been in a bit of a slump here, but hoping to pick up something that pulls me back in. If you’ve got a page-turner suggestion, I’m all ears.
