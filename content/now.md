I've always thought Now pages were cool—they're like a snapshot of someone's current life, priorities, and obsessions.
Here’s what I’m up to right now.

### Life Update

I'm in the process of moving to a new city! Between packing boxes and saying goodbyes, I'm excited to explore new neighborhoods, find my favorite coffee spots, and discover what this next chapter holds.

### Currently Learning

My learning focus is split across a few areas:

- **System Design**: Working through Alex Xu's book to deepen my architecture skills
- **Startup Fundamentals**: Following Y Combinator's YouTube playlist on building startups
- **Cloud Native**: Studying for my CKA certification and Terraform through Kodekloud's courses

### Projects

I'm tinkering with some personal projects at the intersection of AI and music. They're still in early stages, but I'm enjoying the creative process of combining technology with my musical interests.

### Anime & Books

- **Currently Watching**: [My Anime List profile](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pre5ence) - always happy to get recommendations!
- **Reading Slump**: I'll admit I haven't picked up any books lately - need to get back into the habit. If you have any can't-put-down recommendations, send them my way!
