Hey there! I’m [Rahul](/about) — a software engineer who loves building scalable systems, breaking (then fixing) things, and sharing lessons from the startup trenches.
This website is where I document my adventures in code, music, and everything in between. Feel free to explore the other pages, check out my [blog](/blogs), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rahulmysore23) or via [email](mailto:rahulmysore23@gmail.com).

**May your builds never break!**
