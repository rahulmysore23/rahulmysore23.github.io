I’ve spent the past seven years building software that ships—six of them in fast-moving [startups](/journey). I enjoy writing clean, efficient code in Go and working with Linux systems. My background includes a Master's degree in Computer Science and hands-on experience turning prototypes into production-ready systems.

Most of my career has been spent solving infrastructure challenges and improving developer workflows. I've had the opportunity to mentor junior engineers and contribute to open source projects along the way. When I'm not coding, you might find me playing [guitar](/music), lost in the world of [anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pre5ence), tweaking my development environment, or [writing](/blogs) about technical challenges I've encountered.

This website serves as a place to share what I've learned and document my ongoing exploration of technology and systems design.
