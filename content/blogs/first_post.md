Back in the early days of my bachelor's degree, a friend of mine started a technical blog called [The Code Note](http://thecodenote.com). I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Inspired, I decided to start my own blog. I spent days brainstorming a name (which, honestly, I canâ€™t even remember now) and finally launched it. It was your typical "how to solve LeetCode problems" blog. Yeah, I knowâ€”there are already millions of those out there. But hey, it got me started.

I posted a couple of times, following the same old formula: problem statement, solution, and code. While it was a good exercise, it didnâ€™t really excite me. At the time, I had very little real-world experience, and the blog felt more like a checklist item than a passion project. After landing my first job as a software engineer, I eventually deleted the blog. It just didnâ€™t feel like "me."

### After a While

Fast forward five years, and Iâ€™ve been working as a software engineer, wearing all sorts of hats. Iâ€™ve done front-end, back-end, platform engineering, led teams, mentored junior developers, and most importantly, solved a ton of software problems. Itâ€™s been a wild ride, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot along the way.

Even though I deleted that old blog, the desire to share my experiences never really went away. Iâ€™ve always wanted to have a presence on the internet where I could talk about my journey in the tech industry, share knowledge about tools or software that arenâ€™t well-documented, and write about system setups that boost productivity. I also wanted to share solutions to technical problems Iâ€™ve encounteredâ€”things that took me hours (or days) to figure out, but could save someone else a lot of time.

### New Beginnings

Recently, I made a big decision: I quit my job as a software engineer after five years and four companies (three of which were startups). Iâ€™m now pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science. This new chapter is all about learning, growing, and giving back to the community.

One of the things Iâ€™m most excited about is starting this blog. Itâ€™s not just a place to share my experiences as a software engineer, but also a space to write about things that arenâ€™t always easy to understandâ€”whether itâ€™s setting up a development environment, debugging a tricky issue, or exploring new tools and technologies.

This blog is also a commitment to myself. Itâ€™s a promise to be consistent, disciplined, and intentional about sharing what Iâ€™ve learned. I hope it becomes a resource that others find useful, and maybe even inspiring.

Hereâ€™s to new beginnings! ðŸš€
