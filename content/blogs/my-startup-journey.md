### **The Safe Path: Leetcode, Internships, and Corporate Life**  

In the summer of 2018, just before my final year of B.Tech, my friends and I were deep in the Leetcode grind. We lived on HackerRank, battled on Codeforces, and even dabbled in CodeChef contests. All that effort paid off—I landed an internship at **OpenText**, a giant in the CRM and OCR space. (Spoiler: Leetcode *does* work, at least for getting your foot in the door. I hate doing leetcode now, more in another post)  

Three months later, I had a full-time offer in hand—**before I’d even graduated**. A stable job at a global tech company, complete with great benefits, zero stress, and a predictable 9-5 routine. My family was thrilled. By all traditional measures, I’d "made it."  

But something didn’t feel right.  

The excitement I’d felt when I built my first website? Gone. The thrill of solving hard problems? Fading. I was comfortable, but I wasn’t **growing**. That’s when I realized: **I didn’t just want a job. I wanted a journey.**

### **The First Jump: Into Startup Chaos**  

So I did the unthinkable—I quit.  

No backup plan, just a gut feeling that I needed **more**. Luckily, a friend was working at a tiny, newly minted startup. I reached out, interviewed, and within a week, I had an offer.  

**Then came the hard part: telling my parents.**  

To them, startups were synonymous with **risk, instability, and recklessness**. Why leave a sure thing for chaos? It took days of long conversations—explaining, reassuring, and finally convincing them to trust me. (I’ll always be grateful they did.)  

### **The Startup Reality: Highs, Lows, and COVID**  

The new role was **everything I wanted—fast, intense, and unpredictable**. I was writing production database scripts (no room for error), jumping between backend fixes and frontend tweaks, and learning at a pace I’d never experienced before.  

Then, **COVID hit.**  

The startup—like so many others—collapsed. My parents’ worst fears had come true. For the first time, I questioned my choices. Maybe stability *was* the smarter play?  

But giving up wasn’t an option.

### **Rebuilding: Unemployment, Side Projects, and a Pay Cut**  

While job hunting, my friends and I started working on a side project (I can’t share details, but it was **the kind of thing that kept me sane**). I led backend development, hired interns, and got a prototype running.  

After two months of uncertainty, I finally landed an offer—**at a 30% pay cut**. It hurt, but I took it.  

This was an AI/ML startup, and my role was a mix of **backend engineering, ops, and occasional full-stack chaos**. I built CLI tools, wrestled with ClojureJS, and even dipped my toes into infrastructure. It was messy, but I loved it.

### **The Breakthrough: A Call Out of Nowhere**  

Then, out of the blue, I got a call.  

A startup in another city had found my resume on a job portal (one I didn’t even remember updating). The team lead and I **clicked instantly**—bonding over our love for Go, our disdain for Java, and strong opinions on static vs. dynamic typing.  

I aced the interview, got the offer, and faced a tough choice: **Take this role or join an early-stage blockchain startup (fully remote).**  

After some back-and-forth, I chose the first option.

### **The Silicon Valley of India: A Humbling Ride**  

The new city was **India’s startup hub—fast, competitive, and full of people way smarter than me**.  

My first two weeks were a **brutal reality check**. I felt like an impostor. The engineers here operated at a level I hadn’t seen before. But I adapted. I **had** to.  

Soon, I was:  

- Debugging critical issues **on live client calls**  
- Building internal tools that scaled  
- Designing infrastructure that didn’t collapse under pressure  

It was the **most challenging—and rewarding—job I’d ever had.**

### **The End (For Now)**  

Eventually, I decided to **pursue a master’s degree** (a story for another post). But looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing.  

### **What Startups Taught Me**  

1. **Stability is overrated**—if you’re not growing, you’re stagnating.  
2. **Failure isn’t fatal**—it’s just data.  
3. **The best learning happens under pressure**—even when it feels unbearable.  

I took risks, screwed up, fixed things, and **fell in love with the chaos**. And one day, I hope to channel all of it into **my own startup**.  

Until then—**the grind continues.**

### **Final Thought**  

If you’re hesitating between **safe and uncertain**, ask yourself:  

*"Will I regret not trying?"*  

For me, the answer was clear.
