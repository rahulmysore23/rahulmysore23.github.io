It was 2003, I remember playing my first game when I was in my 1st grade. It was a computer lab in my school. The game was called Tux Racer. It was a simple game which had a penquin character that you could control with your keyboard. Another Game that I played on the school computer was called Dave.

My Aunt at my grany's house owned a computer. She used it for work. But me and my cousins used it for fun. We played games. The game was called Prince. It was a simple game which had a prince character that you could control with your keyboard. The main objective of the game was to rescue the princess from the evil wizard. The prince had to cross many obstacles to reach the princess. We spent countless hours trying to figure out each stage and come up with movements that would help us win. Another game that we played was Roadrash. This game was my favorite, It was a bike racing game. An interesting feature of this game was that you can kick the neighbor's bike to throw them off balance. It was funny but quite an effective feature.

One fine day, Me and my sister were able to convince my parents to buy us a video game console. Do you remember the retro games with gaming consoles that connect to your TV? Games like Super Mario, Contra, Circus, Shooting disks, Baseball, and many more. Me and my sister played these games together. While Contra was a favorite among cousins.

I remember those days when I used to sneak out of home to my friend's house in the street to watch him play games. I was a little shy to ask if I could play, so I used to spectate. They used to play WWE, Need for Speed, GTA. I had no computer at home, sneaking out to watch them play was the only option. One fine day my father brought a laptop with him. He got it for his work. I had 30 mins on the laptop every day. I used to play solitaire and Pinball. Slowly I installed a game boy emulator on the laptop with the help of my street friend. That's when I started playing Pokemon firered. This game was out of the world. I was a huge pokemon fan, I played it for hours. I completed the game countless times. I even started playing Pokemon emerald and Ruby. It was basic but addictive. I used to dream about this game and how it would be like to play it in real life.

I also played farmville on facebook. It was a social game where you could grow crops, raise animals, and build a farm. I remember me and my sister playing it together. It was the only reason we were on facebook. I also started to explore online games. Those were mostly miniclip games.
